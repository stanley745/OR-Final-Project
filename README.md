<h2>1. Background and Motivation </h2>

### 1.1 Background:
Green Supply Chain refers to the management between the **facility operation, transportation and environmental effects of all facilities in a supply chain**, i.e. the environment protection constraint is brought into facility location and allocation. Its purpose is to add environment protection consciousness into production and transportation, in order to improve the competitive edge of the supply chain regarding environmental effects.

### 1.2 Motivation:
The aim of most supply chain optimization problems is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain. However, since environmental protection is of concern to the public, a green supply chain,because of its minimum effect on nature, has been seriously considered as a solution to this concern.

### 1.3 Problem Definition:
We want to **minimize the total cost** of the supply chain and **minimize the air pollution discharged from the supply chain** to reduce the impact on the environment.

<h2>2.Green Supply Chain Model </h2>

### 2.1 Supply Chain Model(SCM):
There are some important roles in a supply chian:

1.Manufacturers  
2.Warehouses  
3.Distribution centers  
4.Customers  

And these four roles will have the following five activities:

1.Manufacturer purchase raw materials    
2.Assemble products in Manufacturers  
3.Transport products from Manufacturers to Warehouses  
4.Transport products from Warehouses to Distribution centers  
5.Transport products from Distribution centers to customers


We assume **3 Manufacturers,4 Warehouses,5 Distribution centers,16 Customers**,below figure is an  assumption example which shows the structure of a supply chain:

* **Objective function 2 --> Minimize pollution:**

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149276436-741e0180-dff0-423d-a26d-2e58a0c9fd0f.JPG)


 ### 2.7 Constraints:

(12)–(14) determine the demand of each facility:  
![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149278103-8afbba16-fee2-4f5d-9084-893b1614977a.JPG)


(15) and (16) also calculate the inventory level that each warehouse and distribution center must hold:  
![15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149278113-b75d1b00-3b49-4b21-b18f-90413f675095.JPG)


(17)–(18) also show that the standard deviation of demand for warehouses and distribution centers is defined as the weighted average of the standard deviation of demands assigned to them:  
![17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149278123-303c3105-ebeb-4967-b0c0-1d0de0ff9a16.JPG)


(19)–(21) ensure that we cannot assign a demand to a facility that is higher than its capacity:  
![19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277379-b099d20a-faef-49e1-9b49-bd719e2c6bf0.JPG)

(22)–(24) assure that if a facility does not supply any facility at its lower level, it will be closed and its binary variable is equal to zero:  
![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277514-8e2613e7-b83d-4809-9ed6-72da17b77e5c.JPG)

(25) and (26) guarantee that the total raw material shipped from suppliers to a manufacturer can not be greater than the manufacturer demand, according to the required raw material for one product unit:  
![25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277624-0b17ea65-a632-4a8f-8baa-9c5c84cce3de.JPG)

(27)–(28) ensure that the amount of product transported from a manufacturer and a warehouse must be equal to warehouse and distribution center demand respectively:  
![27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277831-cb22e368-8085-4e79-981b-54bdf18bbb42.JPG)

(29) distribution centers are allowed to not serve the percentage or total demand of a customer:  
![29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277896-eae91369-e110-4407-a757-794893801822.JPG)

(30)–(32) are capacity constraints on transportation means, which prohibit assigning more than their capacity to the transportation means:  
![30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149277933-6709eedb-8b82-444e-86b0-c95de1d6ba14.JPG)


<h2>3. Methodology </h2>

### 3.1 The ϵ-constrained method
We minimize two objectives by setting one objectives to the constraint.

### 3.2 Pyomo
Although the majority of our equations are linear, this is a **nonlinear problem** , subtitute (17)(18) into (15)(16). We call a module from Python,called **"Pyomo"**.  
There is a solver **Ipopt**  can caculate continuous nonlinear problems.

<h2> 4.Analysis Result </h2>


### 4.1 Analyze the different nubmber of manufacturer and distribution center
Both the number of manufacturer and distribution center increase,the cost and pollution are also increased in SCM.  
However,the distribution center has many routes, when the number of distribution centers increases, the cost and pollution increase is larger than that of the manufacturer.
![AAA1111](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51538779/149289120-21d00f06-8ddb-4ccc-a9ae-bb9e332dacf2.JPG)



### 4.2 Analyze the different nubmber of customers
The following pictures show that transportation cost account for large proportion in SCM.  
If the customer number grow ,more products could not deliverd to customer in time so that the backorder cost increase.

<h2>5.Summary </h2>
Manufacturers, warehouse and distribution centers increase, cost and pollution will rise. Each facility has a different rate of increase in cost and pollution.
The company has to consider what their target is.  
However,in reality, the cost and pollution functions may not be linear. This is the part that our model cannot explain.
