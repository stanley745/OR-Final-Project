# Multi-Objective Green Supply Chain Optimizat

<h2>1. Background and Motivation </h2>

### 1.1 Background:
Green Supply Chain refers to the management between the **facility operation, transportation and environmental effects of all facilities in a supply chain**, i.e. the environment protection constraint is brought into facility location and allocation. Its purpose is to add environment protection consciousness into production and transportation, in order to improve the competitive edge of the supply chain regarding environmental effects.

### 1.2 Motivation:
The aim of most supply chain optimization problems is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain. However, since environmental protection is of concern to the public, a green supply chain,because of its minimum effect on nature, has been seriously considered as a solution to this concern.

### 1.3 Problem Definition:
We want to **minimize the total cost** of the supply chain and **minimize the air pollution discharged from the supply chain** to reduce the impact on the environment.

<h2>2.Green Supply Chain Model(SCM) </h2>
There are some important roles in a supply chian:

1.Manufacturers  
2.Warehouses  
3.Distribution centers  
4.Customers  

And these four roles will have the following five activities:

1.Purchase raw materials from Manufacturer   
2.Assemble products in Manufacturers  
3.Transport products from Manufacturers to Warehouses  
4.Transport products from Warehouses to Distribution centers  
5.Transport products from Distribution centers to customers


We assume **3 Manufacturers,4 Warehouses,5 Distribution centers,16 Customers**,below figure is an  assumption example which shows the structure of a supply chain:
